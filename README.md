# cornbot
### A simple stock option notification bot. Takes unusual option behavior from unusualwhales.com and tracks it after inputting it to a local database

**NOT FUNCTIONAL RIGHT NOW, UNUSUAL WHALES HAS UPDATED THEIR WEBSITE AND THE WEBSCRAPER IS NO LONGER FUNCTIONAL.** 

yfinance also does not provide all option data. Option data is occassionally missing and will need to be manually inputted.

---------------

Username and Password inputs can be found in webscraper.py

the backup.db file in extra is an empty database file as a backup. To replace, rename backup.db to options.db and move it to the "Scripts" folder.

The Chromedriver may also be outdated. A newer release can be found at https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
